# Addressing Missing Values

### How to address missing data values in the construction of Machine Learning models.  

Utilized the <A HREF="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Pima+Indians+Diabetes">Pima Indian Diabetes data set</A> in which >50% of the data is incomplete.  This missing data creates a challenge in creating machine learning models.  Addressing these missing values with imputed values allows the entire data set to be used in training and testing machine learning models.
